	<h2>Starting</h2>
	<p>Creating a working copy of this site should be as easy to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Download and install latest symfony edition</li>
		<li>Install Mopa Bootstrap Bundle</li>
		<li>Activate Examples in your Symfony installation</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Finished :) </p>
	<p>or use the <a href="https://github.com/phiamo/symfony-bootstrap-sandbox">sandbox</a>!</p>
	<h2>Intention</h2>
	<p>The main purpose of this bundle was to provide a template for the forms, because the markup of bootstrap, and the markup of symfon2 was too different.</p>
	<p>In the meantime we also adapted, e.g a intuitive form of Navbar/Navbar classes and a bunch of marcos and other bootstrap features.</p>
	<p>Please feel free to commit new Ideas via Pull Request's or create issues for the problems you have at the moment!</p>
	<h2>The Idea</h2>
	<p>Bootstrap has a bunch of features included, and we think it would be nice if you just can show you want to use them, but effectively have no drawback on updates.</p>
	<p>Adapting the markup of e.g. Form to the requirements of a CSS Framework like bootstrap can be quite a mess</p>
	<p>This sandbox and the examples of MopaBootstrapBundle try to give you a feeling on how easy it can be to be up-to-date with your logic to the frontend</p>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>These examples are part of the Mopa Bootstrap Bundle, and are only meant to show you how easy it could be to have a fully working bootstrap Site working. </p>
	<p>To kickstart you could just use the <a href="https://github.com/phiamo/symfony-bootstrap-sandbox">sandbox</a> and start over creating you own Symfony2 project</p>
