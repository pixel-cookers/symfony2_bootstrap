What is it ?
============
A Symfony2 quick launch with basic configurations and often used code & bundles. Includes Twitter Bootstrap for layout & sexy ;)

**Warning: This bootstrap is not ready for use at the moment, I will keep to update it and will tag it when ready for production.**

ToDo :
-----

* Extend FOSUserBundle with a UserBundle for add fields to the model
* Make a set of simple queries / CRUD for quick re-use / samples

* Choose and add an Admin bundle for basic CRUD (propel compatibility)
* Add qKnpMenuBundle
* Add AvalancheImagineBundle
* Add doc for installation and config of the bootstrap
* Add description and demo site to the project

Done :
-----

* Extend FOSUserBundle with a UserBundle for override forms & templates
* Add FOSUserBundle (install, settings & propel support)
* Handle vendors with composer [Issue #1](https://github.com/pixel-cookers/symfony2_bootstrap/issues/1)
* Transfert the vendors to submodules instead of deps
