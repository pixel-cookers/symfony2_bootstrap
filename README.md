What is it ?
============
A Symfony2 quick launch with basic configurations to quickly start your project. Includes Twitter Bootstrap for layout & sexy ;)

**Warning: This bootstrap is not ready and was not updated for while so i don't recommend using it for now. I will try to update it as soon as possible.**

ToDo :
-----

* Move code from BootstrapBundle to CoreBundle for easy use
* Make a set of simple queries / CRUD for quick re-use / samples
* Add qKnpMenuBundle
* Add AvalancheImagineBundle
* Add doc for installation and config of the bootstrap
* Add description and demo site to the project

Done :
-----

* Remove or find a use for the search bar...
* Make a FixtureBundle for add some users/datas
* Extend FOSUserBundle with a UserBundle for add fields to the model
* Extend FOSUserBundle with a UserBundle for override forms & templates
* Add FOSUserBundle (install, settings & propel support)
* Handle vendors with composer [Issue #1](https://github.com/pixel-cookers/symfony2_bootstrap/issues/1)
* Transfert the vendors to submodules instead of deps
